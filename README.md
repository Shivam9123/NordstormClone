<h1>Management</h1>
<p>As I was the only one to work on this project, I had to do all the stuff myself. 1st day I took a deep look in website and noted down the main parts where I have to work perfectly. I first took notes, I broke down the website into small pieces. I collected all the images and after that I took different html extension files and started to work on the project. For every Catagory I took different pages of HTML. first I wrote HTML tags and static information. after that I started to work on Javascript and made some functional part like add to cart and payment etc. at last I started to work on CSS. It took long time than expected but It was all worth to do</p>
